4670,9605,48350,2018-11-22 06:37:32,"Just finished and it was really great. I chained Vulpix for multiple hours, creating a broken Ninetails, and it overleveled the rest of my Pokemon, ruining all of the difficulty of the game. It was really fun, though, and I plan to keep playing the post-game.'"
4671,9606,48351,2018-11-22 06:37:30,the amount of exp you can get is just too much

4681,9630,48375,2018-11-22 06:34:35,The better question is will it make you more or less comfortable with Diglett if you find out? 
4682,9631,48376,2018-11-22 06:34:31,So uh
