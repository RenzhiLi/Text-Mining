4559,9338,62130,2018-11-21 09:05:56,is a fantastic game but I am honestly a little upset with my shiny luck. I have done 3 separate 100+ chains and still havent seen a single shiny. I will still never get a shiny in a main game I have completely given up especially seeing everyones here on Twitter'
