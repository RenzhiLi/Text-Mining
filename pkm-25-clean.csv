2620,3837,13187,2018-11-25 16:31:04,I wish did something to make catching easier in the post game. To have any hope of beating master trainers you have to catch about a billion Pokemon but the RNG still cheats me out of sooo many captures '
2621,3838,13188,2018-11-25 16:31:03,"Just lookit this beautiful slow-ass boy I caught, literally perfect "
2622,3839,13189,2018-11-25 16:30:59,Stopping my Dragonite hunt to catch this was almost disappointing.
