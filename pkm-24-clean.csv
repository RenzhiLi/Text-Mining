1020,1404,20054,2018-11-24 21:02:21,I FINALLY CAUGHT IT 
1021,1405,20055,2018-11-24 21:02:16,The learnsets of the Pokmon in the game were nice however simplified slightly too much and suffered like gen 1 and probably could have done with one or two extra additions to some movepools.E.g. sandshrew not learning dig before I was able to use the Tm. 
1022,1407,20057,2018-11-24 21:01:57,Support trans rights

1024,1410,20060,2018-11-24 21:00:28,The simplifying of the game was handled really nicely in most cases and gave the game more of a smooth progression.

1141,1583,20233,2018-11-24 20:43:02,Glad they kept natures but I wish abilities were included.Having things like sturdy or levitate would have made me think more as a player and have to find alternate ways to deal with certain foes.
1142,1584,20234,2018-11-24 20:43:00,I wonder whos going to be the first person to catch all the shiny variations in ? Thats gonna be one hell of a challenge!'
